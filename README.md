Sign In System (v2)
===================

A web based sign in system for use in small offices.

Usage
-----

This is a jekyll compatible server that can be deployed easily to a server.

To enable the RESTful API to power the system you will need a LAMP (mysql and php) server that can be used to process requests. 

In order for data to pass throughout the system you will also need a data directory at the top level that is writable by the RESTful web server.
